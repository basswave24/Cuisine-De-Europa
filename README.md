European restaurant locator Android App

# About
I have developed this app in college as part of my Mobile Software Development module in 3rd year.<br/>

# How the application works
The user can select any European city , see its restaurants, press on the restaurants, see the restaurants details, see where its located on the map and add it to favourite if he wishes to. <br/> 
When he adds it to favourite he can add a personal note and/or personal rating.The user is then able to view their favourites list, delete any entries they want or update any entries(updating the personal note/rating). 
<br/>The user is also able to add a restaurant to the dataset. The restaurant he adds must have a name/city. 
<br/>After he displays the restaurant, he will able to see it. If the user adds a city thatâ€™s not in the dataset, the city will automatically be added to the dataset. 

# Upcoming Changes
As it stands right now, the database is automatically inserted using a method. I would love to make it get data directly from the internet and keep it updated.<br/>
I would also love to improve the google maps system, such as to give them directions to the restaurants, rather than just place a marker on the map with restaurant location.
